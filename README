 Simple news poster.

 I wrote it as a replacement to rnews for one of tasks in my environment .

 Hopefully it may be usefull for others. Tested w/ innd 2.4.2,  MAY work w/ others.
 No any warranty, as w/ any other software. =) As for me this's pretty scrpit for
 people who wonn't dance around rnews. :-D It's easily configurable.

 Thanks to:

		Special thanks to rserg (http://www.livejournal.com/users/rserg).

 Please write to grey-olli@ya.NOSPAMru (remove NOSPAM 1st) if your another (not innd)
 news server also work OK w/ this script - I'll update README.
 Also you may try to request help or new features for this script. Though answer is 
 not guaranteed - better use sourceforge support request form for a project.

 
 Difference w/ rnews:

   1. Does NOT require msgid in your data - presumes it's generated by news server.
     Though you may supply correct msgid in your text.
   2. Does NOT log msgid of posted messages.
      Though it'll be present in one of debug files, if you turned on debugging (after
      'recommened ID') .
   3. Does NOT store messages that where failed to post.
   4. Accepts data to post ONLY from STDIN.
   5. Does NOT require nor open any innd configs - you may have no innd and be able
      to post w/ this script to other destinations.
   6. Does NOT understand batch format: ALL data from STDIN 'll be posted as message.

   
 Other bonuces:

   1. Config options support customisation of
		'Newsgroups:'
    	'From:'
		'Subject:'
		'X-Comment-To:'
    	'Content-Type:'
		'Content-Transfer-Encoding:'
    	'X-Flags:'
    2. ANY config file OPTION MAY be OVERRIDEn via command line switch (including above Keywords.
	3. Adequate defaults for koi8-r users for 'Content-Type:','Content-Transfer-Encoding:' . =)
    4. As much as it possible w/ perl ( huh! :) ) this script shouldn't eat memory on big files - 
      it parses them line by line w/o loading all the file into memory. =) 

 Notes:

      Write input to file on posting failure is useless for me option - I post to my LAN.
      Though if script 'll get used by other people - I'll add supporting this to my
      '2do' queue. =) Just mail me w/ adequate 'Subject:' (I review mailbox by Subjects
      & most SPAM is being deleted w/o reading. Some times I may delete non-spam mail..
      If you didn't get an answer in a week or two - just mail again).

 The homepage for this script 'll be http://sourceforge.net/projects/stdin2news/ .
