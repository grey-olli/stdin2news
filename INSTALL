Copy script to any place in your $PATH. On your choice you may symlink it to another name.

If running script with '--help' doesn't work:

	Ensure that 1st string in script contains right path to your perl interpreter.
	`which perl` should give your correct path.

	Encure that your system has modules listed in DEPEND .
